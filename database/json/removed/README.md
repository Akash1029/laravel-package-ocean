### This is the directory where we store all the packages that don't pass the health checks anymore. They are not necessarily broken, it's just they were removed from the main database because of some reason which are listed below.


### Removed due to inactivity on Github
If the maintainer wishes to continue maintaining these packages, please contact me and I will add them back to the main database.
