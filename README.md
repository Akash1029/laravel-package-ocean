## Contributing
### Bugfixes or new features
- Feel free to open an issue or a pull request to add a new feature or fix a bug.
### Adding a new package
- The criteria for a package to be added is somewhat opinionated and is a mixture of some guidelines and rules we've set for ourselves.
- Our goal is not to include every package out there, but to include the ones that are useful and actively maintained.
- We try to avoid including commercial/paid packages.
- The number of stars on GitHub is not a factor in deciding whether to include a package or not.
- We may remove packages that do not support recent versions of Laravel and PHP.
- The word "new" which we used in the title and description of the website does not necessarily refer to the release date of the package, but to the fact that it's new to the community member who's discovering it. So if you just published a new package and would like it would be added, we may not simply add it right away.


ðŸŒ¸ Please don't have any hard feelings if we're not including your package in the database ^_^

ðŸ’™ We love you and we appreciate your work and efforts.

## Notes for package creators/owners
- If the information about your package is incorrect, please let us know and we'll fix it right away.
- If for any reason you want to remove your package from the database, please open an issue or ask in discussions. We'll remove it as soon as possible.
